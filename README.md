# KVM Web Interface

![KVM Logo](https://github.com/Geksus/kvm/tree/main/kvmwebapp/static/logo.svg)

This project is a web interface for managing and granting access to KVM (Keyboard Video Mouse) functionality. It allows users to control multiple computers remotely using a web browser, eliminating the need for physical access to each individual machine.

The KVM Web Interface provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies the management and access control of KVM-enabled systems. It leverages the power of KVM to enable remote control of computers, making it convenient for system administrators, support teams, or anyone who needs to manage multiple machines.

## Features

- Remote access: The web interface allows users to grant access to Raritan KVM.
- Multi-platform support: It works with various operating systems that support KVM, including Linux, Windows, and BSD.
- User management: The interface provides user management functionality, allowing administrators to grant access to specific users or groups.
- Role-based access control: Different user roles can be defined with varying levels of access and permissions.
- Audit logs: All actions performed through the interface are logged, providing an audit trail for accountability and troubleshooting.
